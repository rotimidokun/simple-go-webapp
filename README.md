# simple-go-webapp
A basic web application as I pick up the go programming language. Hosting a repo will allow for code reviews.


Here's how I built the Web App - https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/

To run app:

  1. git clone https://github.com/rotimidokun/simple-go-webapp.git

  2. go build main.go

  3. go run main.go

  4. Visit http://localhost:8080/view/test. "test" is the name of the sample document.
  
  5. Edit a page and save to update.
